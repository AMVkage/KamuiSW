            <p3><h1>Welcome to the Synestia development log/wiki!</h1>
            <h5><strong>The Start</strong><br>
                In 2019, I started learning unity. I searched up tones of tutorials back then, and used stuff i found on the internet. <br>
                I slowly got better with programming and made alot of prototypes, but never actually finished any of those. Now after 4 years, <br>
                i think i could make a full unity game without searching up tutorials, so thats what i did. i started creating a project called "Synestia", and started working on it.<br>
                If you played the Breakthrough Minecraft mod, you will find a lot of familiar enemies and structures. <br>
                that is because I work together with the developer of the Breakthrough mod. We are close friends in real life, <br>
                and we just thought it would be cool if we connected our universes together.</h5>
            <h5><strong>Development Log #1</strong><br>
                today I added basic movement. WASD to move, space to jump and ctrl to crouch. <br>
                next dev log I will be working on an inventory system.</h5>
            <h5><strong>Development Log #2</strong><br>
                I implemented a simple inventory system this time. You can find this on my itch.io</h5>
            <h5><strong>Development Log #3</strong><br>
                I added a simple melee attack and ranged attack feature. <br>
                and what cool is that it works with the inventory system. <br>
                you do not want to know how long that sh*t took man.</h5>
            <h5><strong>Development Log #4</strong><br>
                I added some more types of weapons. also i added a level system and level lock system. <br>
                also, a quest system so you can accept quest and get some stuff lol. <br>
                This update can be found as 0.2 update. you can try it out!</h5></p3>
